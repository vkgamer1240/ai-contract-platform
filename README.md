## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security First**: Before running the application, read `SECURITY.md` and set up your environment variables properly.

### Environment Setup
1. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```
2. Edit `.env` and add your API keys (never commit this file!)

### Quick Start

1. **Run the setup script**:
   ```bash
   python setup_premium.py
   ```

2. **Start the web interface**:
   ```bash
   python premium_app.py
   ```

3. **Access the platform**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`

### Manual Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install torch transformers flask requests pandas numpy
   ```

2. **Set up Groq API** (optional but recommended):
   - Get your free API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
   - Set environment variable: `export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key`

3. **Verify model files**:
   Ensure you have the CUAD model files:
   - `config.json`
   - `pytorch_model.bin`
   - `tokenizer_config.json`
   - `vocab.json`
   - `merges.txt`

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:5000` to access the web interface where you can:
- Upload contract text
- Ask specific questions
- Get full contract analysis

### 3. Model Evaluation

Evaluate your model's performance:

```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```

This will show:
- Model statistics
- Prediction analysis
- Performance on sample data

## Model Capabilities

The model can extract various types of information from legal contracts:

- **Governing Law**: Which jurisdiction's laws govern the contract
- **Termination Clauses**: Conditions under which the contract can be terminated
- **Liability Provisions**: Limitations and allocations of liability
- **Payment Terms**: Payment schedules, amounts, and conditions
- **Intellectual Property**: IP ownership and licensing terms
- **Confidentiality**: Non-disclosure and confidentiality requirements
- **Force Majeure**: Extraordinary circumstances provisions
- **Warranty**: Warranties and guarantees provided
- **Dispute Resolution**: Methods for resolving disputes
- **Renewal Terms**: Contract renewal and extension conditions

## API Usage

### Single Question Analysis

```python
from transformers import RobertaTokenizer, RobertaForQuestionAnswering

tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained('./')
model = RobertaForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('./')

context = "Your contract text here..."
question = "What are the payment terms?"

inputs = tokenizer.encode_plus(question, context, return_tensors='pt')
outputs = model(**inputs)
# Process outputs to get answer...
```

### Web API Endpoints

- `POST /analyze` - Analyze single question
- `POST /analyze_full` - Full contract analysis

## Performance Tips

1. **Text Length**: The model has a maximum sequence length of 512 tokens. For longer contracts, consider chunking the text.

2. **Question Formulation**: Use clear, specific questions for better results:
   - Good: "What are the payment terms?"
   - Better: "What is the payment schedule and amount?"

3. **Confidence Scores**: The model provides confidence scores. Lower scores may indicate:
   - The information isn't in the contract
   - The question is ambiguous
   - The text is unclear

## Customization

To adapt the model for other legal document types:

1. **Fine-tune further**: Use additional domain-specific data
2. **Adjust questions**: Modify the predefined questions in the scripts
3. **Post-processing**: Add domain-specific post-processing rules

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**: Use services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud
2. **Create API**: Build a RESTful API for integration
3. **Mobile App**: Develop mobile applications
4. **Integration**: Integrate with document management systems
5. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple contracts simultaneously

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Memory Errors**: Reduce batch size or text length
2. **Slow Performance**: Use GPU if available (`model.to('cuda')`)
3. **Poor Results**: Check if the contract language matches training data

## Model Limitations

- Trained primarily on English contracts
- Performance may vary with non-standard contract language
- Cannot understand context beyond the provided text
- May struggle with highly technical or domain-specific terms
